        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          You create a Donation Match Challenge, selecting a charity or group of
          charities close to your heart. Then invite friends to participate by
          making a donation to your chosen causes. The twist? The user pledges
          to match every donation their friends contribute, doubling the overall
          impact. It's a friendly competition to increase true donation matching
          (doubling money which would not have been donated otherwise) and
          create a ripple effect of positive change!
